        "description":"The training of quantum support vector machines (QSVM) can also be run on a quantum annealer, as demonstrated by Willsch et al. in a recent paper. To achieve this, the problem, like any problem solved via quantum annealing (QA), must first be formulated as a QUBO. However, the training of SVMs entails solving equations that contain real numbers whereas a QUBO consists of binary values. Willsch et al. use a special encoding to overcome this and thus are able to formulate the problem as a QUBO. Willsch et al. investigate the performance of their QSVM on a DW2000Q quantum annealer. They note that the quantum annealer returns in addition to the global optimum, a range of solutions that are close to the optimal. They furthermore note that this is advantageous as the generalization ability may potentially be improved by using a combination of the produced solutions. In summary, a QVSM can be trained using via QA by formulating the problem as a QUBO. A QA device, such as the DW2000Q, produces optimal and near-optimal solutions and a combination of these solutions can potentially improve the generalization behaviour."
